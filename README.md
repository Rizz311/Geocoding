## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Map API

I am using the Google Map API and connecting it to a form I made it will take in an address and allow the user to either use enter or clicking the submit to get a result.

## Optimizations
I am still learning about the Google Maps API and I want to incorporate an autocompleter to help get an accurate address entry.

## Lessons Learned:
I have learned some useful knowledge of the Google Maps API and how to use forms and other outside elements to with the Google Maps API.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
